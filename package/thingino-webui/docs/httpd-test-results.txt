BusyBox httpd Subdirectory ACL Override - Test Results
=======================================================

Test Configuration:
-------------------
/:testuser:testpass         # Protect root
/onvif:*:                   # Open access to /onvif/
/public:*:                  # Open access to /public/
/admin:admin:secret         # Admin with different credentials

Test Results:
-------------

✓ Test 1: GET /
  Expected: HTTP 401 + WWW-Authenticate header
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized + WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Web Server Authentication"
  Status:   PASS - Root path requires authentication

✓ Test 2: GET /onvif/
  Expected: HTTP 200 + NO WWW-Authenticate header
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 200 OK + <h1>ONVIF - Open Access</h1>
  Status:   PASS - /onvif/ is completely open (NO auth challenge sent)

✓ Test 3: GET /public/
  Expected: HTTP 200 + NO WWW-Authenticate header
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 200 OK + <h1>Public - Open Access</h1>
  Status:   PASS - /public/ is completely open (NO auth challenge sent)

✓ Test 4: GET / with credentials (testuser:testpass)
  Expected: HTTP 200 + content
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 200 OK + <h1>Root - Protected</h1>
  Status:   PASS - Correct credentials accepted

✓ Test 5: GET / with wrong credentials
  Expected: HTTP 401 + WWW-Authenticate header
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized + WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Web Server Authentication"
  Status:   PASS - Wrong credentials rejected

✓ Test 6: GET /admin/ with credentials (admin:secret)
  Expected: HTTP 200 + content
  Result:   HTTP/1.1 200 OK + <h1>Admin - Protected</h1>
  Status:   PASS - More specific path overrides parent

Summary:
--------
ALL TESTS PASSED ✓

The patch successfully implements subdirectory ACL override:
- Parent directories can require authentication
- Subdirectories marked with "*:" completely bypass authentication
- No HTTP 401 or WWW-Authenticate header is sent for open paths
- More specific paths override less specific ones
- Clients accessing /onvif/ and /public/ don't see any authentication challenge

This is exactly the behavior requested: / is protected with password,
but /onvif/ is openly accessible with NO Basic Auth prompt at all.
