# Example BusyBox httpd configuration with subdirectory override
# 
# This demonstrates how to protect the root directory with a password
# while allowing completely open (no auth challenge) access to specific
# subdirectories like /onvif/

# Protect everything under / with Basic Authentication
# This will send HTTP 401 + WWW-Authenticate header
/:admin:password123

# Allow completely open access to /onvif/ subdirectory
# This overrides the parent rule - NO auth challenge is sent
/onvif:*:

# Alternative syntax - empty credentials also means open access
/public:

# You can also have different credentials for different paths
# More specific paths always win
/admin:superuser:secret456

# Test behavior:
# curl http://localhost/              → 401 Unauthorized (requires auth)
# curl http://localhost/index.html    → 401 Unauthorized (requires auth)
# curl http://localhost/onvif/        → 200 OK (no auth, completely open)
# curl http://localhost/onvif/device  → 200 OK (no auth, completely open)
# curl http://localhost/public/       → 200 OK (no auth, completely open)
# curl http://localhost/admin/        → 401 Unauthorized (requires superuser:secret456)
